The goal of this session is to discover convnets using [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

We will reproduce the methods and results of this paper: [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)

1. Conv2D ninja
2. Build the PlainNet model
3. Build the ResNet model (the main ResNet class is given)
4. Train the various models on CIFAR-10 and report the results
5. (*) Add Kaiming init to ResNet.  Does it help?

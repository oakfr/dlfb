The Deep Learning Foundations Bootcamp provides hands-on training to the foundations of deep learning. The course combines theoretical foundations and hands-on programming, often starting from scratch.

The course consists in 6 sessions of 3h each.  Each session combines 1-2h of theoretical training and 1-2h of hands-on coding.

This course is targeted at engineers who want to build or strengthen their deep learning skills.

Prior knowledge of machine learning is not expected.

Knowledge of Python and basic knowledge of linear algebra are expected (targeted linear algebra refreshers are included).

Syllabus:

- Session 1: Intro to DL, gradient descent
- Session 2: DL fundamentals I (backprop, loss functions)
- Session 3: DL fundamentals II (activation functions, regularization, initialization, residual networks, normalization)
- Session 4: Attention and Transformers
- Session 5: DL for computer vision (convnets, unets)
- Session 6: VAE and Diffusion
